      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Cultural and societal changes are an undeniable influence on our lives, yet it is so difficult to accurately quantify and track these developments. The principle issue is identifying metrics that appropriately encapsulate such a complex and intractable set of phenomena. Using U.S. baby name and Census country-of-origin data, we seek to find an appropriate proxy for nationwide diversification. Due to the strong ties between one’s name and country of origin, ethnicity, and religion, we believe distribution of baby names over time to be powerful predictors of demographic trends.  After exploration and analysis of the given data as well as existing historical US demographics data, we ultimately decided to build a model to predict the percentage of foreign-born residents using name distributions as predictors.  Using this model, we aim to interpolate the corresponding intercensal data regarding percentage of foreign-born residents in each state population in every year from 1910 to 2014.

      <p>
        Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we performed PCA, cross-validating number of components with model score as well as explained variance.  We eventually concluded that 17 was the optimal number of components for the transformation. We then trained different preliminary regression models to predict percentage of foreign-born residents in each state in each year, using only counts of each name in each state as predictors. We eventually selecting Random Forests for its high score on multiple train-test splits.  We cross-validated number of trees in the forest with model score, determining that 50 was the optimal number of estimators.

  <!-- DATA -->

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        We started with a simple data frame that contained name counts for states in the US for every year since 1910. We converted this data frame to the predictors data frame. In the new data frame every column contains the count of every name in the original data frame for every decade in a given year.

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        In order to better visualize the data, Tableau Analytics were utilized (fig. 3). A light-to-dark blue gradient (whose range is 0–30%) colors each state according to the share of foreigners in the registered population for each year. Fig. 4 was instrumental for quantitatively comparing our predicting and test sets. This multi-state analysis (NY, CA, FL, TX) afforded more granularity than the state visualizations alone, for example in calculating the model’s predictive errors for each decade. To validate these observations, we looked to historical precedent to help qualitatively frame the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heatmaps indicate an overall decrease in foreigners from 1910–1970, with a sharp nationwide rebound post-1970. This roughly coincides with two important historical events in the history of U.S. immigration: the 1924 Johnson-Reed quota, severely limiting immigration to a select few groups of Europeans; and the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act effectively reversing the quota laws in place since the 20s. Demonstrates the confluence between the economic (the Depression in the 30’s), the military (WWII), and the political (immigration acts), and their role in affecting demographic data.

		Our calculated predictions can be classified along two principle dimensions: geographic and temporal.  This necessitates a multimedia approach to representing the data. In order to better visualize the results, Tableau Analytics were utilized (fig. 3). Annual nationwide heatmaps of our predictions were generated, allowing geographic comparison. Each of these heatmaps has been layered into a combined timeline, which best illustrates the time-varying aspect of the data.  A light-to-dark blue gradient was chosen, with extremes set at 0 and 30%. This gradient colors each state according to the share of foreigners in the registered population for each year. Fig. 4 was instrumental in quantitatively comparing our predictions and test sets. The multi-state analysis (NY, CA, FL, TX) afforded more granularity than the state visualizations alone, for example in calculating the model’s predictive errors for each decade. To validate these observations, we relied on historical precedent to help qualitatively frame the data.
      </p>
      <p>
		Some generalizations can be extracted from this long-term view. Overall, in terms of gross historical migration, the heatmaps indicate a decrease in immigrants from 1910–1970, with a sharp nationwide rebound post-1970.

		Using the distribution of baby names per state in a given year as our predictor yields a rather close fit to the real data. We are excited about the powerful potential in state map visualizations, believe the interactive timeline slider juxtaposing heatmaps with scatter plots in an excellent way to concisely, yet comprehensively, represent our data.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		(Further Avenues of Exploration)
		We hope to expand our predictor’s detail by slicing foreign-born groups into specific regions and predicting these regional distributions. Incorporation of more detailed Census data would be helpful, doubling the number of test observations to score our prediction against.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        The baseline model is promising; using the distribution of baby names per state in a given year as our predictor yields a rather close fit to the real data. We are excited about the powerful potential in state map visualizations, and seek to develop an interactive timeline slider juxtaposing multiple state images. We hope to expand our predictor’s detail by slicing foreign-born groups into specific regions and predicting these regional distributions. Incorporation of more detailed Census data (IPUMS) is necessary.
