      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Cultural and societal changes are an undeniable influence on our lives, yet it is so difficult to accurately quantify and track these developments. The principle issue is finding one (or even a group of) metrics that appropriately encapsulates such a complex and intractable set of phenomena. Using U.S. baby name and Census country-of-origin data, we seek to find an appropriate proxy for nationwide diversification. Armed with these demographic trend predictors, we ultimately interpolate the missing data between 1910 and 2000, since the Census only captures decadal snapshots.

      <p>
        Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we performed PCA, cross-validating number of components with model score as well as explained variance.  We eventually concluded that 17 was the optimal number of components for the transformation. We then trained different preliminary regression models to predict percentage of foreign-born residents in each state in each year, using only counts of each name in each state as predictors. We eventually selecting Random Forests for its high score on multiple train-test splits.  We cross-validated number of trees in the forest with model score, determining that 50 was the optimal number of estimators.

  <!-- DATA -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        We started with a simple data frame that contained name counts for states in the US for every year since 1910. We converted this data frame to the predictors data frame. In the new data frame every column contains the count of every name in the original data frame for every decade in a given year.

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        In order to better visualize the data, Tableau Analytics were utilized (fig. 3). A light-to-dark blue gradient (whose range is 0–30%) colors each state according to the share of foreigners in the registered population for each year. Fig. 4 was instrumental for quantitatively comparing our predicting and test sets. This multi-state analysis (NY, CA, FL, TX) afforded more granularity than the state visualizations alone, for example in calculating the model’s predictive errors for each decade. To validate these observations, we looked to historical precedent to help qualitatively frame the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The heatmaps indicate an overall decrease in foreigners from 1910–1970, with a sharp nationwide rebound post-1970. This roughly coincides with two important historical events in the history of U.S. immigration: the 1924 Johnson-Reed quota, severely limiting immigration to a select few groups of Europeans; and the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act effectively reversing the quota laws in place since the 20s. Demonstrates the confluence between the economic (the Depression in the 30’s), the military (WWII), and the political (immigration acts), and their role in affecting demographic data.

  <!-- CONCLUSIONS -->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        The baseline model is promising; using the distribution of baby names per state in a given year as our predictor yields a rather close fit to the real data. We are excited about the powerful potential in state map visualizations, and seek to develop an interactive timeline slider juxtaposing multiple state images. We hope to expand our predictor’s detail by slicing foreign-born groups into specific regions and predicting these regional distributions. Incorporation of more detailed Census data (IPUMS) is necessary.
