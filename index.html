      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Cultural and societal changes are an undeniable influence on our lives, yet it is so difficult to accurately quantify and track these developments. The principle issue is finding one (or even a group of) metrics that appropriately encapsulates such a complex and intractable set of phenomena. Using U.S. baby name and Census country-of-origin data, we seek to find an appropriate proxy for nationwide diversification. Armed with these demographic trend predictors, we ultimately interpolate the missing data between 1910 and 2000, since the Census only captures decadal snapshots.
